# gbemulator

Inspired by the Rust NES emulator I have decided to write a Gameboy emulator in
my favourite programming language.

I have never written an emulator before and because writing one requires a lot
experimentation, the code may not be the cleanest for a while as I am constantly
using many debugging statements to figure out where I'm going wrong.

## Status

Currently the emulator only gets as far as displaying the Nintendo logo.
